# NekoNi2 [BETA]

NekoNi2 is a Discord bot currently in BETA, with the main code written in Python.  
The bot is designed to be simple to use, and most commands are accessed by prefixing them with a comma: ```,` ``.  
For example, you can type `,help` or `,command` to interact with the bot.

## How the Bot Works

- **Design Focus:** The bot aims for simplicity and ease-of-use for server members.
- **Current Status:** The bot is still in BETA and new features or improvements are ongoing.
